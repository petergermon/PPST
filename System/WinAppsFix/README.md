<h2>WinAppsFix</h2>

This script uses the <i>Get-AppXPackage</i> cmdlet to retrieve a list of all Windows Apps and the <i>Add-AppxPackage</i> cmdlet to reset each app. The -AllUsers parameter ensures that the reset applies to all users on the system. The <i>-DisableDevelopmentMode</i> parameter disables developer mode during the reset process, and the <i>-Register</i> parameter specifies the path to the AppXManifest.xml file for each app.

After resetting all Windows Apps, the script restarts the computer using the <i>Restart-Computer</i> cmdlet to apply the changes.

Run it in a PowerShell terminal to reset Windows Apps and restart the system. 

Note that resetting Windows Apps may interrupt any ongoing app activity and may cause temporary loss of app data, so be sure to save your work before running this script. Additionally, restarting the computer will close any open programs and unsaved work, so be sure to save your work before running this script.
