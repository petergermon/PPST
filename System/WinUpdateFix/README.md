<h2>WinUpdateFix</h2>

This script first checks if it's running with elevated privileges and displays a warning message if not. It then stops all services associated with Windows Update by using the <i>Stop-Service</i> cmdlet and a list of service names.

Next, the script purges the Windows Update cache and files by using the <i>Remove-Item</i> cmdlet to delete various files and folders under the <i>SoftwareDistribution</i> directory.

After that, the script changes directory to the system32 folder and registers various DLL files using the <i>regsvr32.exe</i> command.

The script then performs Winsock Reset and Winsock Reset proxy by using the <i>netsh</i> command to reset various network-related settings.

After resetting the necessary settings, the script starts all services associated with Windows Update by using the <i>Start-Service</i> cmdlet.

Finally, the script restarts the computer to apply the changes.
