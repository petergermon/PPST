<h2>WinUpdateFix</h2>

This script first checks if it's running with elevated privileges and displays a warning message if not. It then stops all services associated with Windows Update by using the <i>Stop-Service</i> cmdlet and a list of service names.

Next, the script purges the Windows Update cache and files by using the <i>Remove-Item</i> cmdlet to delete various files and folders under the <i>SoftwareDistribution</i> directory.

After that, the script changes directory to the system32 folder and registers various DLL files using the <i>regsvr32.exe</i> command.

The script then performs Winsock Reset and Winsock Reset proxy by using the <i>netsh</i> command to reset various network-related settings.

After resetting the necessary settings, the script starts all services associated with Windows Update by using the <i>Start-Service</i> cmdlet.

Finally, the script restarts the computer to apply the changes.

Run it in a PowerShell terminal to stop Windows Update and BITS services, purge the Windows Update cache and files, perform Winsock Reset and Winsock Reset proxy, register BITS and Windows Update files, start Windows Update and BITS services, and restart the system. Note that performing these actions may interrupt any ongoing Windows Update or BITS activity and may cause temporary loss of update data, so be sure to save your work before running this script. 

Additionally, restarting the computer will close any open programs and unsaved work, so be sure to save your work before running this script.
