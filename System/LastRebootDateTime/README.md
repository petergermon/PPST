<h2>LastRebootDateTime</h2>
To use this script, you can save it as a .ps1 file and run it in a PowerShell terminal with the appropriate parameter. 

For example, if you want to zero out deleted data on the C: drive, you can run the script with the following command:

<i>.\lastrebootdatetime.ps1</i>

This will output the last reboot date and time.
