<h2>WinsockReset</h2>
This script uses the netsh command to reset the Winsock catalog by running the command netsh winsock reset, and to reset the TCP/IP stack by running the command netsh int ip reset. These commands reset various network-related settings, including network protocols, Winsock LSPs, and network adapters.

<br>Finally, the script restarts the computer to apply the changes. This is necessary because resetting the Winsock catalog and TCP/IP stack requires a reboot to take effect.

Run it in a PowerShell terminal to reset the Winsock catalog. Note that resetting the Winsock catalog may interrupt any ongoing network connections and may cause temporary loss of connectivity. Also, be aware that restarting the computer will close any open programs and unsaved work, so be sure to save your work before running this script.
