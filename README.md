Powershell Scripts that can be ultilised to debug technical issues that may arise within the Windows Operating System.

You will need to enable execution of powershell scripts in order for these scripts to work!
<b>Enable Powershell Scripts:</b>
<!-- <br><i>Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned</i> : Runs scripts created on the device. However, scripts created on another computer won't run unless they include a signature of a trusted publisher.
<br>
<br><i>Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned</i> : All the scripts will run as long as they've been signed by a trusted publisher. -->
<br>
<br><i>Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted</i> : Runs any script without any restrictions.

After running these scripts, it's a good security practice to disable execution of powershell script files.
<b>Disable Powershell Scripts:</b>
